                    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
                    <p>Alfred Nobel was born in Stockholm, United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway on 21 October 1833.
                        He was the third son of Immanuel Nobel (1801–1872), an inventor and engineer, and Karolina Andriette Nobel (née Ahlsell 1805–1889).
                        The couple married in 1827 and had eight children.
                        The family was impoverished and only Alfred and his three brothers survived beyond childhood.
                        Through his father, Alfred Nobel was a descendant of the Swedish scientist Olaus Rudbeck (1630–1702),
                        and in his turn, the boy was interested in engineering, particularly explosives, learning the basic principles from his father at a young age.
                        Alfred Nobel's interest in technology was inherited from his father, an alumnus of Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Following various business failures, Nobel's father moved to Saint Petersburg,
                        Russia and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives.
                        He invented the veneer lathe (which made possible the production of modern plywood)
                        and started work on the torpedo. In 1842, the family joined him in the city.
                        Now prosperous, his parents were able to send Nobel to private tutors and the boy excelled in his studies,
                        particularly in chemistry and languages, achieving fluency in English, French, German and Russian. For 18 months,
                        from 1841 to 1842, Nobel went to the only school he ever attended as a child, in Stockholm.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Nobel gained proficiency in Swedish, French, Russian, English, German, and Italian.
                        He also developed sufficient literary skill to write poetry in English.
                        His Nemesis is a prose tragedy in four acts about the Italian noblewoman Beatrice Cenci.
                        It was printed while he was dying, but the entire stock was destroyed immediately after his death except for three copies,
                        being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous.
                        It was published in Sweden in 2003 and has been translated into Slovenian, French, Italian, and Spanish.

                    <h2>Scientific career</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a young man, Nobel studied with chemist Nikolai Zinin; then, in 1850, went to Paris to further the work.
                        There he met Ascanio Sobrero, who had invented nitroglycerin three years before.
                        Sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin because it was unpredictable,
                        exploding when subjected to variable heat or pressure. But Nobel became interested in finding a way to control
                        and use nitroglycerin as a commercially usable explosive; it had much more power than gunpowder.
                        In 1851 at age 18, he went to the United States for one year to study,
                        working for a short period under Swedish-American inventor John Ericsson, who designed the American Civil War ironclad, USS Monitor.
                        Nobel filed his first patent, an English patent for a gas meter, in 1857, while his first Swedish patent,
                        which he received in 1863, was on "ways to prepare gunpowder".
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        The family factory produced armaments for the Crimean War (1853–1856),
                        but had difficulty switching back to regular domestic production when the fighting ended and they filed for bankruptcy.
                        In 1859, Nobel's father left his factory in the care of the second son, Ludvig Nobel (1831–1888),
                        who greatly improved the business. Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself
                        to the study of explosives, and especially to the safe manufacture and use of nitroglycerin. Nobel invented a detonator in 1863,
                        and in 1865 designed the blasting cap.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>
                        On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Sweden,
                        killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother Emil.
                        Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in Vinterviken so that
                        he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to
                        handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and
                        the building of transport networks internationally. In 1875,
                        Nobel invented gelignite, more stable and powerful than dynamite, and in 1887, patented ballistite, a predecessor
                        of cordite.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                        Nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr (diatomaceous earth)
                        it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as dynamite.
                        Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England.
                        In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with
                        dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance "Nobel's Safety Powder",
                        but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the Greek word for power (δύναμις).
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Nobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to collodion,
                        but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent ,
                        jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. Gelignite, or blasting gelatine,
                        as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition
                        of potassium nitrate and various other substances. Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to
                        fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds. It was adopted as the
                        standard technology for mining in the Age of Engineering, bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a
                        cost to his health. An offshoot of this research resulted in Nobel's invention of ballistite, the precursor of many modern
                        smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.

                            Nobel was accused of high treason against France for selling Ballistite to Italy, so he moved from Paris to Sanremo,
                            Italy in 1891. On 10 December 1896, he suffered a stroke and died. He had left most of his wealth in trust,
                            unbeknownst to his family, in order to fund the Nobel Prize awards. He is buried in Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

                            Nobel was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates
                            for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an honorary doctorate from Uppsala University in 1893.

                            Nobel's brothers Ludvig and Robert founded the oil company Branobel and became hugely rich in their own right.
                            Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions.
                            During his life, Nobel was issued 355 patents internationally, and by his death, his business had established more
                            than 90 armaments factories, despite his apparently pacifist character.

                <hr/>

                    <p>On November 27, 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his third and last will at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris. When it was opened and read after his death, the will caused a lot of controversy both in Sweden and internationally, as Nobel had left much of his wealth for the establishment of a prize. His family opposed the establishment of the Nobel Prize, and the prize awarders he named refused to do what he had requested in his will. It was five years before the first Nobel Prize could be awarded in 1901.</p>
                <hr/>


                <h2>The establishment of the Nobel Prize</h2>
                <p>In this excerpt of the will, Alfred Nobel dictates that his entire remaining estate should be used to endow “prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind”</p>
                <p>“All of my remaining realisable assets are to be disbursed as follows: the capital, converted to safe securities by my executors, is to constitute a fund, the interest on which is to be distributed annually as prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.</p>
                <p>The interest is to be divided into five equal parts and distributed as follows: one part to the person who made the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics; one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction; and one part to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses.</p>
                <p>The prizes for physics and chemistry are to be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical achievements by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be selected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that when awarding the prizes, no consideration be given to nationality, but that the prize be awarded to the worthiest person, whether or not they are Scandinavian.”</p>
